## Motivation

SecretAgent Aims to create an AI-powered cybersecurity developer tool to identify security vulnerabilities.

## Description

Our project combines simple web attacks such as SQL injections, network request interceptions, and brute force attacks with a Cohere large language model to scan through a web repository and inform the developer of vulnerabilities.

The backend server was implemented using Python and Flask, and Selenium was used to scrape repository data.

The frontend web interface was created using React and JavaScript.
