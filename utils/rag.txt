Purpose

The goal is to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Databricks models that specializes in analyzing client-side code, network requests, and other potential security vulnerabilities. This system will:

Accept inputs in the form of:

Network request logs (e.g., captured using tools like Selenium, browser DevTools, or proxies).

Articles, online resources, or documentation.

Client-side source code.

Provide insights into vulnerabilities, focusing on:

Weak or insecure API endpoints.

Poorly implemented authentication mechanisms.

Exposed sensitive data (e.g., keys, tokens).

Potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities.

Misconfigured CORS policies.

Architecture

1. Data Ingestion

Input Formats:

JSON logs from network activities.

Plaintext or Markdown articles.

Code files (JavaScript, TypeScript, or HTML).

Preprocessing:

Parse logs for request/response pairs.

Tokenize articles and identify relevant sections.

Normalize and format code inputs for token-level analysis.

2. Knowledge Base (KB)

A repository of vulnerability patterns, best practices, and remediation steps.

Indexed using vector search for quick retrieval.

3. Databricks Model Integration

Model Capabilities:

Question-answering for specific vulnerabilities.

Classification of security issues by severity.

Code completion with security recommendations.

RAG Workflow:

Retrieve relevant knowledge base snippets based on user inputs.

Augment the Databricks model’s prompt with retrieved context.

4. Output Generation

Security audit reports, including:

Identified vulnerabilities.

Suggested remediations.

Risk scoring for prioritization.

Real-time interactive debugging and recommendations for client-side code.

Sample Inputs and Outputs

Input 1: Network Request Log

{
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "http://example.com/api/login",
    "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic abc123",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "body": "{\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"password123\"}"
}

Output 1: Vulnerability Report

**Vulnerability:** Weak Authentication Method
**Details:** Basic authentication detected. Credentials are sent in plaintext, exposing them to potential interception.
**Remediation:** Switch to OAuth2 or other token-based authentication mechanisms. Use HTTPS for all requests.

Input 2: Client-Side JavaScript Code

const apiKey = "my-secret-api-key";
fetch("http://example.com/api", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`
    }
});

Output 2: Vulnerability Report

**Vulnerability:** Exposed API Key
**Details:** Hardcoded API key detected in client-side code. This allows attackers to access sensitive resources if the code is exposed.
**Remediation:** Store API keys securely on the server-side and access them via secure backend endpoints.

Input 3: Article on CORS Policies

"CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism to allow or restrict resources on a web server depending on the origin of the request."

Output 3: RAG-Enhanced Response

**Key Insights:**
- Ensure CORS policies are configured to only allow trusted origins.
- Avoid wildcard origins (*) in production environments.
- Implement proper headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` for secure communication.

Implementation Steps

1. Setting Up the Knowledge Base

Gather and preprocess security best practices, OWASP guidelines, and vulnerability databases.

Store documents as vector embeddings using libraries like FAISS or Milvus.

2. Preprocessing Pipelines

Tokenize inputs (e.g., logs, articles, and code) into chunks.

Identify relevant sections using keyword matching and semantic similarity.

3. Model Integration

Use a Databricks-hosted model fine-tuned for security-related tasks.

Implement the RAG pipeline to combine retrieved KB context with user queries.

4. Interface Development

Build a simple web interface for users to upload files or paste content.

Display vulnerability reports and recommendations in a user-friendly format.

Tools and Libraries

Databricks: Model training and hosting.

Vector Search: FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate.

Frontend: React.js for user interaction.

Backend: Flask or FastAPI for handling requests.

Preprocessing: Python libraries like pandas, regex, and langchain for data handling.

Next Steps

Define sample vulnerability patterns and add them to the KB.

Train a Databricks model on labeled security data.

Test the system with real-world logs, code, and articles.

Considerations

Ethics: Ensure the tool is used responsibly and doesn’t facilitate malicious activities.

Performance: Optimize KB retrieval for minimal latency.

Scalability: Design the system to handle large inputs, such as comprehensive codebases or extensive logs.
